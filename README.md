> [Java/Kotlin] An Optical Music Recognition Software 


## Project Description

  This project aims to digitize the information contained in music sheets and attempts to re-create it as a functional MIDI. 
  
  Through computer vision technology and image pattern recognition, the program will eliminate artifacts in a scanned musical staff to read each note and produce an audible sound instantaneously. 
  Use of this program can aid those learning an instrument better audiate the musical flow of different segments of a music sheet and interpret it in a digestable format of sound as he encounters it.
  Instant playback of scanned music is a function targeted towards beginner users. It will acclimate them towards learning the complex nature of music theory, such as key signatures, time signatures, and note values.
  The project will be realized through an Android application for portability and ease-of-use.
